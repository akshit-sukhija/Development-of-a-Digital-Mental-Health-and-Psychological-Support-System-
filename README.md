## 🔍 Problem Statement

Many individuals experience early signs of emotional strain — such as stress, fatigue, or feeling overwhelmed — but often struggle to decide:

- Whether their emotional distress requires additional support  
- How to respond to early or mild well-being concerns  
- When to seek help versus manage through self-care  

Because these signals are often subtle and non-specific, people may delay support, minimize their own well-being, or feel uncertain about next steps.

There is a need for **responsible early-stage guidance** that supports reflection **without clinical judgment or escalation**.

It is intentionally built to be:

2. The system performs **lightweight, rule-based signal detection** to identify early, non-clinical emotional patterns  
3. Inputs are mapped to one of four **guidance categories**:
   - Self-care suggested
